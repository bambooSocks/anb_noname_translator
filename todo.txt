What did I manage:
 - consolidate if processes
 - worked on agents checking (each transaction has the same agent)
 - worked on retrieving correct cells when needed
 - delayed checking
   - retrieve old message when needed (decided not to store the whole state, but store separate cells)
 


What to do:
 - if statements
   - test it out
 - delayed checking
   - save message if needed later
   - store it related to agent
 - crypt has 3 params for now use S ??
 - deal with agent picking ...
 - start defining the syntax
   - headers
     - sigmas
     - agents
     - knowledge
     - custom cells
     - bound
     - gamma0 ?? (low prio rn)
   - actions
     - local
     - comm
     - if action

Extra:
 - merge registers
 - gamma0





Q:
 - do we store every message or we prescan to find the ones that we need to?
 - private and public in sigma - difference?
 - do we actually need Knowledge?
 - what do we do with the two sigmas?

 - can we fix the random parameter of crypt and scrypt to S????
