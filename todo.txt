again what do I do:
- finish analysis !!!!!
- update the translation function !!!!
- start with translation function !!!!
- update the parser so that all sections are not required !!
- update the ident to not come from lexer but as a var const fusion !!
- generate translated code !
 

What to do:
 - agent picking
   - if B doesn't know it's name it has to pick it for themselves
 - fuse all "new" declarations (Pl cannot follow after new :/ )
 - proper testing
 - in verbatim code

Extra:
 - merge registers
