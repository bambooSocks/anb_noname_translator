What did I manage:
 - consolidate if processes
 - if statements
 - agent checking for actions (correct action order)
 - delayed checking
   - decided to do dynamic loading of cells
   - retrieve old message when needed (decided not to store the whole state, but store separate cells)
 - cleaned up the code and split it up more
 - implemented sigma0 sigma sigmaP
 

What to do:
 - delayed checking
   - save message if needed later
   - store it related to agent
 - deal with agent picking ...
 - proper testing
 - start defining the syntax
   - headers
     - sigmas
     - agents
     - knowledge
     - custom cells
     - bound
     - gamma0 ?? (low prio rn)
   - actions
     - local
     - comm
     - if action
 - in verbatim code

Extra:
 - merge registers
 - gamma0
